This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Modifications
**A list of the modifications made from the version of this project created in Colt Steeles React Boot-camp on Udemy:**

* The color scheme was changes to be more cohesive. Rather than blues, pinks, and purples, the application uses several shades of blue.
* A "Clear Jokes" button was added that allows users to easily clear all existing data about jokes from their local storage, in addition to reloading the page with ten new jokes.
* The system that sorts jokes was modified to only sort jokes when new jokes are fetched or when the page reloads to prevent the jokes from rapidly jerking upwards or downwards when either upvoted or downvoted respectively.
* The initial state of the application was modified so that the loading spinner shows if jokes are fetched when the application first loads.
* Some small tweaks in terms of formatting the code.
